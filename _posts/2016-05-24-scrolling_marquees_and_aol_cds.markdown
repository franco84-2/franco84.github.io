Back in the 90's my first foray into computing was with a device called the WebTV. I will never forget that quirky machine. It got you online in the worst possible way. It had a terrible user interface with no mouse and was riddled with nonsensical features. I never truly knew how bad it was until I got my first computer, a Compaq with a 4gb hard drive. And yet, it had its moments and could be fantastic. I was able to use custom IRC webapps that would let me connect to the servers and chat rooms I wanted to, while being able to load songs (Real Audio files..) in the background. For a device that was essentially a single page web browser, discovering this type of functionality was a blast. From time to time I would create sites on Geocities, Tripod, and Angelfire; internet 1.0 at its finest. I had a fascination with marquees and text generators which brought such excitement at the time. It was an era where anybody could make a crappy website. Now, I'm happy they're gone because I'd almost rather say I never made one than show it off.

When I finally got my first computer, using AOL initially seemed like a huge upgrade. Trust me, as hard as it may seem to believe, being able to multitask and believing AOL was the reason skewed the results. Aside from that, I became proficient at using windows, tweaking it, and using all kinds of software just out of curiousity. I took a deeper dive than everyone I knew. Although I was far from a hacker, everyone thought I was. I was definitely becoming the "IT Wizard" of the family. I used to spend a lot of time in IRC, discussing software, trading, and tweaking. I made a lot of online friends and we shared all sorts of information on what programs we found interesting. At one point I did do some basic programming in high school, and a few years ago I managed to teach myself to write automation scripts using macro scheduler. One script that was a few thousand lines that I knew like the back of my hand felt like quite the accomplishment, and was used, tweaked, and upgraded for almost two years.

My first job helped me save up the cash to build my first custom PC with a friend. It had a *blazingly fast* 4X Acer cd burner. From that point on until now, I've probably built two dozen or so custom computers for friends and family. Usually with only a budget and usage in mind, I would try to get the best parts available and have a ton of fun putting it together with friends. To this day, I can say confidently that 95%-99% of the people I know have never intentionally modified their windows registry, used linux or any type of command line interface. But there was no web development courses when I went to college. I took a computer science course that counted towards the major and it was three months defining basic hardware and software. Tt felt remedial at best and that was that.

It took a bit for me to decide to become a student at a coding school, but there are finally tools in place to help me learn while working full-time. Before discovering Learn, it was difficult not being able to be online 24/7 like in high school to learn everything I need to. With a structured course that has built in tests and fleshed out projects, I can definitely learn web development the way I wanted to back then, by people who understand how to deliver the material clearly and with real world applications. The innate curiousity and joy from software engineering has always been within me, I'm just finally giving it the exposure it deserves.ffff
